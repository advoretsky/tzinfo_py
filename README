A python tool for automatically generating a module containing datetime.tzinfo
objects for most major timezones. The data source is the zoneinfo database
provided by IANA here:

http://www.iana.org/time-zones

KNOWN ISSUES:
A few rules are inconsistantly provided in UTC times, which means that they may
be inaccurate for a few hours around changes.
